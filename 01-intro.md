# Introduction

This project defines WASI APIs for embedded devices with the aim of providing a common language and platform independent runtime for embedded use, simplifying targetting a variety of embedded platforms, supporting dynamic discovery and hot reloading of applications, and making it easy to design / share / mess with embedded things.

The WASI APIs are intended to span from basic peripheral drivers like SPI and I2C, to more complex functionality like driving LEDs or displays and publishing or subscribing to data. Everything one could need to write unreasonably portable IoT applications.

To get started using embedded-wasm, check out the [Getting Started](./02-getting-started) section.
